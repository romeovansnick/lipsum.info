# lipsum.info

[lispum.info](https://lipsum.info) is a very simple lorem ipsum site.

## Why?

I built this because the lorem ipsum site I normally copy from,
[lipsum.com](https://lipsum.com) has started to show cookie banners.

While I comment the authors for correclty following GDPR and disclosing their tracking practices, I
do not agree that one needs tracking for such a simple site.
